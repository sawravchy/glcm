<h2>The way GLCM can be applied:</h2>

The result of a texture calculation is a single number representing the entire window. This number is put in the place of the center pixel of the window. Then the window is moved one pixel and the process is repeated of calculating a new GLCM and a new texture measure. In this way, an entire image is built up of texture values. Thatâ€™s how different texture properties of GLCM can be calculated of road and sky images.
